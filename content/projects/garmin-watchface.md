# Garmin WatchFace (Pedro raccoon)

> Pedro the dancing raccoon

It is an Internet phenomenon (again). The dancing raccoon spinning in circles. As made for a WatchFace, right? ;-)

And that's exactly what I've done. An animated WatchFace for Garmin Smartwatches.

> Fun fact: You can write racoon and raccoon. Both spellings are right.

# Programming and stuff

So in short: I have developed a watch face for garmin smartwatches that shows the pedro raccoon dancing in circles and showing the time.
