## A ticketing tool to the rescue

We all know the situation of starting a small project that gets bigger and bigger. At first, a simple note or a readme file can handle your ideas and open bugs. But as soon as beta users test your application you need an easy solution to capture their feedback.

> Golden rule: Make the feedback process for your beta testers as easy as possible! Beta testers should focus on testing your application instead of struggling with a complicated feedback circle.

And that's exactly what I'm looking for:

* Easy-to-use ticketing tool
* A portal for anonymous users to create tickets (service desk)
* Simple dashboard to manage open and closed tickets

## Peppermint

One simple solution is the so-called [Peppermint Ticketing Tool](https://github.com/Peppermint-Lab/peppermint). A simple and easy ticketing tool for small applications.

All of the above mentioned features are included and can handle different products.

Remember that this tool will never replace a professional ticketing tool ( which I'm not going to mention here ;-) ). This is not the aim of this tool, but rather to focus on the essentials, namely handling tickets.

Try it out, it's free and open source.
